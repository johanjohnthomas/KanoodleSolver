Project Plan: Kanoodle Solver
Vision: A web application that allows users to set up a Kanoodle board, get hints, and see solutions. The application will be aesthetically pleasing and intuitive to use.

Sprint 1: Basic UI and Drag-and-Drop
Goal: Create the basic UI with the board and pieces, and implement drag-and-drop functionality to move pieces onto the board.
User Stories:
As a user, I want to see the Kanoodle board.
As a user, I want to see all the available Kanoodle pieces.
As a user, I want to be able to drag a piece from the piece area and drop it onto the board.
Sprint 2: Game Logic and State Management
Goal: Implement the core game logic, including placing pieces, validating moves, and managing the game state.
User Stories:
As a user, when I drop a piece on the board, it should snap to the grid.
As a user, I should not be able to place a piece in an invalid position (e.g., overlapping another piece or outside the board).
As a user, I want the board state to be updated when I place a piece.
Sprint 3: Solver and Hint Functionality
Goal: Implement the "solve" and "hint" features.
User Stories:
As a user, I want to be able to click a "solve" button to see the solution for the current board configuration.
As a user, I want to be able to click a "hint" button to have one piece placed in a correct position.
As a user, I want the hint to be different each time I click the button.
Sprint 4: Game Flow and Controls
Goal: Implement the "play" and "reset" buttons and the associated game flow.
User Stories:
As a user, I want to be able to click a "play" button to start the game.
As a user, when I click "play" on an empty board, the board should be set up with a random starting position.
As a user, I want to be able to click a "reset" button to return the board to the state it was in when I clicked "play".
As a user, I want the reset state to be updated if I use the "hint" button.
Sprint 5: Settings and Customization
Goal: Implement the settings panel.
User Stories:
As a user, I want to be able to open a settings panel.
As a user, I want to be able to customize the appearance of the board and pieces.
As a user, I want to be able to choose different board layouts.
Sprint 6: Deployment
Goal: Deploy the application to GitHub Pages.
User Stories:
As a user, I want to be able to access the application via a public URL.
As a developer, I want the application to be automatically deployed when I push changes to the main branch.
